<h2>What is a beta?</h2>

<p>Beta software is pre-production quality software. It is released with
the intention of providing the software's users with insight into where
the software feature-set is going for a particular release cycle,
getting as wide a base of testers for the release as possible and
gauging the uptake of new features. </p>

<p>The software may not be entirely complete yet and may be buggy. We
highly value your input and urge you to evaluate the software in a test
environment. We do however strongly suggest you do not to implement this
version of KnowledgeTree in a production environment as we can't warrant
it functioning correctly.</p>
