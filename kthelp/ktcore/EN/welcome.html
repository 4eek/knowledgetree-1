<p class="descriptiveText">We believe that KnowledgeTree 3.0 Release Candidate 
is now stable enough for production evaluation. If you are intending on installing 
KnowledgeTree over the next few months we strongly urge you to evaluate the 
3.0 Release Candidate and consider it for production use. 
There will be an upgrade path for 3.0 Release Candidate to 3.0 Final.</p>
