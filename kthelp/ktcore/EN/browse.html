<h2>Browse Documents</h2>
<p>You use the Browse Documents section to navigate the 
repository  either by folder, by document type, or by lookup value  the 
default is browse by folder.</p>
<h3>Folder Actions</h3>
<p>You use the Folder Actions buttons to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add new folders.</li>
	<li>Add multiple documents to the repository at once  
	either by uploading a zip file (bulk import), or by specifying a server path 
	(bulk upload) to a location to upload all the documents and files at that 
	location to the repository.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Subscriptions</h4>
<p>Subscribing to a folder allows you to receive notifications 
that tell you when that folder is modified. An email notification is sent to you 
if you have provided your email address when subscribing. Your alerts and 
notifications are also displayed on the Dashboard. </p>
<h4>Search</h4>
<p>KnowledgeTree provides three versatile search options  
simple (quick) search, advanced search, and saved searches. Search is 
permissions-based, so the system only returns items that the logged in user is 
allowed to access. </p>
<p> </p>
<h5>Simple (quick) search</h5>
<p>Specify a search term to search all text - including 
document metadata and the contents of the following file types (if your 
administrator has configured these options): MS Word, MS Excel, MS PowerPoint, 
Adobe PDF, and Plain Text files.</p>
<h5>Advanced Search</h5>
<p>Define criteria to launch a detailed Boolean search of the 
repository. This search allows more detailed search requests (using document 
metadata). For example, you can search for all MS Excel documents containing the 
word 'Invoice'.</p>
<h5>Saved search</h5>
<p>The saved search function allows KnowledgeTree 
administrators to pre-save useful advanced searches. For example, you may want 
to save a search that shows all documents in a completed state of a workflow. 
Saved searches save time on commonly used searches. </p>
<h3>Document Actions</h3>
<p>The Document Detail screen summarizes key information about 
the currently selected document. The Document Actions pane on the left of the 
screen provides a set of buttons for working with the document. </p>
<h4>Download</h4>
<p>You can download a file to open it, or to save it, without 
checking it out of the repository. </p>
<h4>Check-in / Check-out</h4>
<p>Check out a document to temporarily remove it from the 
repository while you update it. While its checked out, other users cant check 
it out to make changes. The version is incremented when the document is checked 
in  a metadata version snapshot is created.</p>
<p>An administrator can override the checked out status of a 
document if the user has failed to check-in a document. In this case, the user 
needs to check-out the document again and redo their changes.</p>
<h4>Metadata</h4>
<p>Metadata is the information about a document that describes 
how, and when, and by whom, a particular set of data was collected, and how the 
data is formatted.</p>
<p>KnowledgeTree groups metadata fields into fieldsets. A 
fieldset is a set of related information, which can be attached to a 
document.  For example, lets say we specify a Project fieldset as follows:</p>
<p><b>Project</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Project Name</li>
	<li>Division</li>
	<li>Cost Estimate</li>
	<li>Implementation Status</li>
</ul>
<p>This project fieldset can be attached to any document type 
that relates to a project; and all members of that fieldset (i.e. project name, 
division, cost estimate, implementation status) would apply. A plug-in could be 
written, which uses the information in the Project fieldset, to provide 
reporting information on a project level, or on a project-based hierarchy of 
documents.</p>
<h4>Delete</h4>
<p>Deleted documents remain in the repository (in DMS 
Administration) until the KnowledgeTree administrator either expunges them or 
restores them. </p>
<p>See Administration  Document Storage  Restore or Expunge 
Deleted Documents</p>
<h4>Move</h4>
<p>Only users with the required permissions for a folder are 
allowed to move an item to another location in the repository. </p>
<h4>Transaction History</h4>
<p>This feature provides a record of all transactions 
performed on the document: create date, uploads, downloads, check-out, check-in 
and the previous deletion of the document if it has been restored.</p>
<h4>Version History</h4>
<p>This feature provides a record of all past and current 
versions of a document. A new document version is created whenever a document is 
checked-out then subsequently checked-in again. The version history feature 
allows you to download older documents and compare them with more recent 
versions.</p>
<h4>Links</h4>
<p >Document links allow you to establish 
associations between documents in the repository. Your KnowledgeTree 
administrator needs to create the Document Link Types that you use to link 
documents. When creating a document link, the administrator specifies the type 
of relationship that the link implies between the 
linked documents  i.e. associated with, or duplicated by. </p>
<h4>Version Control</h4>
<p>KnowledgeTree has powerful document version control 
features, which ensure that the editing and versioning of documents is done in a 
controlled and auditable manner. Newly created documents are assigned as version 
0.1. The first time you check it out for editing and then check it back in 
again, the version number increments to version 1. Each subsequent check out / 
check in causes the version number to increment by 1. </p>
<p>A document may only be checked out for editing by a single 
user at a time. When a document is checked back in, you need to specify the 
changes you made.</p>
<p>Users and groups who have read or write access to a 
document are allowed to download it for viewing only  you can choose to open 
the document in your Web browser or save it to your local computer.  You can 
view a version history of all changes to the document, and you can download 
previous versions for comparison. </p>
<p>Any changes you make to the document you downloaded won't 
display in the version in the repository unless you check out the document, and 
then check it back into the repository with your changes.</p>
<p>Any user that logs in to KnowledgeTree can view the list of 
documents they have checked out (if any) in the Checked-out documents section of 
the Dashboard. </p>
<h4>Permissions</h4>
<p >Permissions in KnowledgeTree are 
folder-based  permissions that have been allocated for a specific folder apply 
to all the documents in that folder.</p>
<p >There are four default types of 
permissions: Read, Write, Add Folder, and Manage Permissions. </p>
<p >Users that have only Read permission on 
a document can view the document and its metadata, but are not allowed to change 
it. Users that have Read and Write permissions are allowed to change the 
contents of a document, as well as its metadata. </p>
<p >Users with the Add Folder permission are 
allowed to create and edit sub-folders within their group folder. </p>
<p >Users with the Manage Permissions 
permission are able to edit permissions within their group folder.</p>
