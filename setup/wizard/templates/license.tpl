<p>
<h3>Company's responsibility for End Users</h3>

with all of the terms of this Agreement. Any action or breach by any of the Company's employees,
contractors, agents or Affiliates shall be deemed an action or breach by the Company of this

Agreement.

<h3>Fees and Payment</h3>

</p>
<p>
License fee: The Company shall pay to KT an amount specified on the KnowledgeTree website for the
number of End Users that Company selects. Payment of the license fee shall be due and payable as set

refundable. The Company will also pay all applicable taxes, including sales, use, personal property,

including penalties and interest, imposed by any federal, state, provincial or other government entity on
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
</p>
<p>

maintain accurate records necessary to verify the number of End Users. Upon KT's written request, the
Company shall provide KT with such records within ten (10) days. If the Company has more End
Users than the Company has paid for, the Company shall immediately pay KT an additional license fee

</p>

sub-license any of its rights under this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
<h3>DECOMPILING, DISASSEMBLING, OR REVERSE ENGINEERING</h3>
The Company acknowledges that the Software contains trade secrets and other proprietary information
of KT and its licensors. Except to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement or by the laws of
the jurisdiction where the Company is located, it may not decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse
engineer the Software, or engage in any other activities to obtain underlying information that is not
visible to the user in connection with the normal use of the Software.
</p>
<p>
In particular, the Company agrees not for any purpose to transmit the Software or display the
Software's object code on any computer screen or to make any hardcopy memory dumps of the
Software's object code. If the Company believes that it requires information related to the
interoperability of the Software with other programs, it shall not decompile or disassemble the
Software to obtain such information, and it agrees to request such information from KT at the address
listed below. Upon receiving such a request, KT shall determine whether the Company requires such
information for a legitimate purpose and, if so, KT will provide such information to the Company
within a reasonable time and on reasonable conditions.
</p>
<p>
In any event, the Company will notify KT of any information derived from reverse engineering or such
other activities, and the results thereof will constitute the confidential information of KT that may be
used only in connection with the Software.
</p>
<p>
<h3>DURATION AND TERMINATION</h3>
The license granted to the Company is effective for 1 (ONE) year. The license will also terminate
automatically without any notice from KT if the Company fails to comply with any term or condition
of this Agreement. Upon termination, KT may also enforce any rights provided by law. The provisions
of this Agreement that protect the proprietary rights of KT will continue in force after termination.
</p>
<p>
<h3>SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE</h3>
Software Maintenance includes KT's provisioning to the Company of updates and/or enhancements of
the Software made generally available to customers from time to time, and online technical support
(and where applicable, phone support) to one Company-designated technical contact for the sole
purpose of addressing technical issues relating to the use of the Software (excluding any form of on-
site visits by KT personnel or contractors).
</p>
<p>
<h3>DISCLAIMER OF ANY WARRANTY</h3>
KT does not warrant that the functions contained in the Software will meet the Company's
requirements or that the operation of the Software will be correct, uninterrupted or error-free. KT

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS-IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR
NONINFRINGEMENT.
</p>
<p>
The Company assumes responsibility for the support and fault-finding of any modifications made to
the Software, or merger and integration undertaken with or between any other program or code.
The Company assumes full responsibility for the selection of the Software to achieve its intended
results, and for the installation, use and results obtained from the Software. The Company also assumes
the entire risk as it applies to the quality and performance of the Software. Should the Software prove
defective, the Company (and not KT, or its distributors or dealers) assumes the entire cost of any and
all necessary servicing, repair or correction.
</p>
<p>
Some countries/states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not
apply to the Company. KT disclaims all warranties of any kind if the Software was customized,
repackaged or altered in any way by any third party other than KT.
</p>
<p>
<h3>INFRINGEMENT</h3>
During any term of this Agreement, if any portion of the Software is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to infringe any third party intellectual property rights and the Company incurs a liability or
expense as a result of such holding, then the Company's sole remedy shall be, and KT will, at its
option: (i) obtain the right for the Company to continue to use the Software consistent with this
Agreement; (ii) modify the Software so that it is non-infringing; or (iii) replace the infringing
component with a non-infringing component, or (iv) refund all money paid in the then-current calendar
quarter under this Agreement and all of the Company's rights and licenses under this Agreement shall
automatically terminate.
</p>
<p>
<h3>PUBLICITY RIGHTS</h3>
<ol>
<li>a.	The Company grants KT the right to include the Company as a customer in promotional
material for the Software or for KT.</li>
<li>b.	The Company can deny KT this right by submitting a written request via e-mail to
marketing@knowledgetree.com requesting to be excluded from such promotional material.
Confirmation of such denial (via reply e-mail) must be received prior to purchasing for this to
be effective.</li>
<li>c.	Should the Company come to be or already be included in promotional material, as a result of
any prior purchases where the Company did not request exclusion from the promotional
material, the Company can at any point, submit a written request via e-mail to
marketing@knowledgetree.com to have KT remove the Company's name from the
promotional material. Upon receipt of such request, KT will remove any reference to the
Company from such promotional material within 30 days and make no further reference to the
Company.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
During any term of this Agreement, the Company grants to KT a non-transferable, non-exclusive,
license to reproduce and display its logos, trademarks, trade names and similar identifying material so
that KT may refer to the Company as a user of the Software should KT so desire, such as on the KT
website, in press releases and in other marketing materials.
</p>
<p>
<h3>INDEMNIFICATION</h3>
If the Company distributes the Software in violation of this Agreement, it hereby indemnifies, hold
harmless and defends KT from and against any and all claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees and
costs that arise, result from or are connected with the use or distribution of the Software in violation of
this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
<h3>LIMITATION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES</h3>
In no event will KT or its licensors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential
damages, or for any personal injury or bodily injury (including death) to any persons caused by KT's
negligence, or for any lost profits, lost savings, loss of use, lost revenues or lost data arising from or
relating to the Software or this Agreement, even if KT or its licensors have been advised of the
possibility of such damages. In no event will KT's liability or damages to the Company or any other
person ever exceed the amount paid by the Company to use the Software, regardless of the form of the
claim.
</p>
<p>
Some countries/states do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or
consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to the Company.
</p>
