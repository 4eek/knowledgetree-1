<h2>Document Routing Information</h2>

<p>The document routing information shows the sequence of steps
in the document collaboration process.</p>

<p>This information is set up on a per-folder basis and refined
on a per-document basis. </p>

<p>For each folder, the following needs to be specified at each
step of the sequence:</p>

<ol>
 <li>The group to which the collaborator belongs.</li>
 <li>The role of the collaborator.</li>
 <li>The sequence number.</li>
</ol>

<p>Click the Add/Update button to save a step and return to the Edit
Folder Details page. Pressing the Cancel button will cancel the edit.</p>

<p>As steps are added/updated they are displayed in sequential order on
the Edit Folder Details page.</p>
