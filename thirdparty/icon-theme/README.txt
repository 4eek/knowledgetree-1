Note about icon themes:

it is strongly recommended that you replace this with an icon-theme 
naming convention compliant icon-theme.  For example, we generally use
the Tango icon theme (www.tango-project.org).  However, since this
is licensed under a Creative Commons license we are unable to distribute it
with the main content.

Simple copy the contents of the tango theme into this directory to use it.

If you get _no_ icons, ensure that there is a .htaccess file inside that directory
(e.g. if you symlink from /usr/share/icons/).
