KnowledgeTree DMS- Frequently Asked Questions

Question:
When viewing the index.html of KT through Apache, I am redirected to the control.php, which gives me only
<html><head></head></html>

In the Apache error_log I see:
PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined function:  mysql_pconnect() in /var/www/html/knowledgeTree/phplib/db_mysql.inc on line 73

Answer:
your PHP installation doesn't have MySQL support compiled in.
To verify this, create a test.php file with the following in it:
<?php phpinfo(); ?>

In the output, you should see a MySQL section (my phpinfo output is
attached).

If you're using a default RedHat rpm installation of PHP- MySQL support is not compiled in.
There are some helpful user comments at the bottom of this PHP manual page: http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.databases.php,

Question:
the Search/Advanced Search sections seem to not work. Is it due to a
problem in my configuration or this feature is not yet implemented?

Answer:
The search option will only work once the indexer has been used to
index the documents (the file indexer can be downloaded from our website
as well)

Question:
I logged in once using the default admin user/pass and now when I try to log back in I'm getting the message "Maximum sessions for user reached.
Contact the System Administrator"
Answer:
Each user has a maximum number of sessions defined in the database:
users.max_sessions.  If you close your browser without logging out, the
system still regards you as logged in until the session times out
($default->sessionTimeout).  You can increase the max_sessions value for the
admin user with the following sql:
UPDATE users SET max_sessions=10 WHERE username='admin';
Or you can remove the entry from the sessions table and remember to logout:
DELETE FROM active_sessions;

Question:
I get this error:
 Warning: Access denied for user: 'dms@127.0.0.1' (Using password: YES)
 in C:\FoxServ\www\knowledgeTree\phplib\db_mysql.inc on line 73
 Database error: pconnect(localhost, dms, $Password) failed.
 SQL Error: ()
Answer:
This is a MySQL user configuration problem- make sure that you can
login to mysql from the command line using the same user name and password:
> mysql -udms -p dms
If you don't get in, then you need to check your PHPMyAdmin settings again,
or alternatively use the user/password that PHPMyAdmin uses to access MySQL.

Question:
KT/control.php  redirects me to http://<myhost>/dms/presentation/login.php?loginAction=loginForm" where I get a 404 file error.
There is no dms directory in my web root, or even in the Knowledge Tree directory.
Answer:
You're being redirected to the wrong webroot because of the following
misconfigured entry:
$default->rootUrl (this should = "/knowledgeTree" in your installation instead of the default "/dms")
