KnowledgeTree Internationalisation (i18n)
-----------------------------------------

Overview
--------
Support for i18n has been added to the KnowledgeTree- however, we are not in a position to
begin translating the KnowledgeTree until all the text and graphics in the application are marked for translation.
This is a mammoth task that will require the support and aid of the KnowledgeTree community :)

Requirements
------------

i18n requires gettext (http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext) and the gettext php module to work
(see http://php.net/gettext for installation instructions).

Completed Tasks and Implementation Details
------------------------------------------

- i18n/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES
			   /graphics
			   
- gettext support loaded if php module available

- dashboard and document browse view i18n'd

***TODO****
- checks the browser's Accept-Language header and uses that language (if there is a translation for it)


The TODO List
-------------

The rest of the KnowledgeTree needs to be i18n'd.
Here are some guidelines for adding gettext support to the KnowledgeTree.

- find translatable strings and wrap literals with _()
	eg. change:
	
	to:
	 _("Checked Out Documents")
- if strings are concatenated with dynamic content use sprintf
    eg. 
- add ordering to sprintf parameters- use single quotes so slashes aren't escaped in the .po files
    eg.
	sprintf(_('Hi %1$s, welcome back to the %2$s DMS, part of the Knowledge Tree')

Testing
-------
- install gettext command line utilities
- run xgettext to generate .po files
- write a test translation
- use msgfmt to compile your translated file
- change the default language and verify
  - you may have to specify the complete locale ie <langcode>_<countrycode>
