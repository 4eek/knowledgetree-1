        - names instead of usernames, line breaks etc (html/txt?)

  - Subscription refactoring
      - Use a factory and distinct DocumentSubscription and FolderSubscription classes
  - All common UI code- headings, document/folder path, candystriping, status and error messages

    - decide what is core and what is optional
    - how to decouple logic into modules- documentActions

- Zip functions
  - Mass up/download
    - download- zip up and download file lists (folders, categories, document types, search list)

    - Allow zips to be browsed and contents accessed.
- Shortcuts  
  - Folder: Add a shortcut to a document in the dms from a folder
- Allow addition of URLS
- Add number of documents to folder view, or change folder icon (open/closed)based on folder contents
- Automated Test Suite
  - For Coverage and performance tests
- Write custom error handler
- Security audit
- Make logging robust, spin off as Log4Php?  Or use PEAR Logging class.
- Document Routing
  - Allow overrides on a per document basis
  - Manage the routing sequence numbers in the application.
  - Routing starts automatically when a document is added
  - Routing templates- the roles are specified and default users are chosen when creating a folder
  - Specify a group in a routing step- all the people in the group must review/approve
  - Allow routing to be restarted
  - While a document is being routed, the current version of the document must only be available to users
    involved in the process.  Other users see the version before routing started
  - If a user has a read approval step, the user must not have access to "reject" the step
- Search
  - Search all document and folder properties
  - Accomodate custom search terms- $fCustomSearchxxx
- Allow thumbnails for image types (API for any other filetype)
- Permission model- allow breaking of permission inheritance (integrate with serving multiple organisations)
- Multi-document select in a folder (for delete, move etc.)
