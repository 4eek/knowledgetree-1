Search Permissions
------------------

Search Permissions allow the two site searches to determine if a user is
allowed to have a document returned as a result of their search.

The user can have permission for the following reasons:

	1) The user is in a group that has permission to view documents
	in the folder the document is in.

	2) The user is the creator of the document.

	3) The user is currently assigned a role in the document
	approval/routing process.

	4) The user is a systems administrator.

There are two times when search permissions need to be updated - when
the document's permissions change somehow, or when a user gains or loses
membership to a group.

Search permissions on a document needs to be updated when:

	1) The document is created. (done)

	2) New permissions are added to the folder that determines the
	permissions on that document. (done)

	3) Permissions are removed to the folder that determines the
	permissions on that document. (done)

	4) The folder that determines the permissions on the document
	changes by copying permissions to a folder. (done)

	5) The folder that determines the permissions on the document
	changes by the document being moved. (not done yet)

Search permissions of a user needs to be updated when:

	1) The user is added to a group. (done)

	2) The user is removed from a group. (done)
