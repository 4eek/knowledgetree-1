KnowledgeTree Installation Notes
--------------------------------

*  KnowledgeTree requires the following software to run:
   -  Apache 1.3 or above
   -  MySQL 4.0 or above with INNODB support
   -  PHP 4.3.0 or above, but not yet PHP 5.0


*  Move the knowledgeTree folder to the directory it is going to be served from:
   $ mv knowledgeTree /path/to/your/html/directory/


*  Check the pre-installation checkup:

   If your knowledgeTree installation is at http://localhost/, go to:

       http://localhost/setup/


*  Create a database:
   $ mysqladmin -p create dms


*  Create and populate the tables:
   $ mysql -p dms < sql/mysql/install/tables.sql


*  Configure your installation by changing the following attributes in config/environment.php:
   - Set the database properties to point to your MySQL installation
        $default->dbUser           = "root";
        $default->dbPass           = "pass123";
        $default->dbHost           = "localhost";
        $default->dbName           = "release112";


*  Check permissions on the Documents folder
   - The "/Documents" folder MUST be able to be written to by your web server.
     If your web server is running as user "nobody" and group "nobody" (apache default)
     then cd to the files directory and type:

     *nix: 'chown -R nobody.nobody Documents'
     Windows: Check the permissions and security tabs


*  Check permissions on the log folder
   - The "/log" folder MUST be able to be written to by your web server.
     If your web server is running as user "nobody" and group "nobody" (apache default)
     then cd to the files directory and type:

     *nix: 'chown -R nobody.nobody log'
     Windows: Check the permissions and security tabs


*  Check the post-installation checklist:

   If your knowledgeTree installation is at http://localhost/, go to:

       http://localhost/setup/

   And click on "Post-installation checkup".


*  Login:
   - in a web browser goto http://$default->serverName/$default->rootUrl/
   - default user is "admin" with password "admin"


*  Setting System Settings:
   - Click on 'Admin'.
   - Select System Settings.
   - Check that the values are the same as the ones in your environment.php
     (Note: If you are not using LDAP you can leave these settings as is)
   - Click 'Update' to save these settings.
