KnowledgeTree Installation Notes
--------------------------------

*  KnowledgeTree requires the following software to run:
   -  Apache 1.3 or above
   -  MySQL 4.0 or above with INNODB support
   -  PHP 4.3.0 or above, but not yet PHP 5.0

*  Check that the following PHP configuration options are set appropriately in php.ini:
		error_reporting  =  E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE
		file_uploads = On
		upload_tmp_dir = C:\PHP\uploadtemp
		upload_max_filesize = 2M
		session.use_cookies = 1
		magic_quotes_gpc = On
		magic_quotes_runtime = Off
		
*  Move the knowledgeTree folder to the directory it is going to be served from:
   $ mv knowledgeTree /path/to/your/html/directory/

*  Create a database:
   $ mysqladmin -p create dms

*  Create and populate the tables:
   $ mysql -p dms < sql/mysql/install/tables.sql

*  Configure your installation by changing the following attributes in config/environment.php:
   - The fileSystemRoot property should point to the directory you installed the KnowledgeTree in eg.
		$default->fileSystemRoot  = "C:\Documents and Settings\michael\Desktop\php\knowledgeTree";
		
   - The serverName property should be the name of the webserver you're accessing the KnowledgeTree from eg.
   		$default->serverName = "localhost";
   		
   - If the KnowledgeTree is not install in the root of your webserver, ie. you access the KnowledgeTree via a URL like 
     http://localhost/knowledgeTree, you must set the rootUrl property appropriately.
     Eg. If your webserver root is "c:\myWebServerRoot" and you install KnowledgeTree into that directory (ie. 
     $default->fileSystemRoot = "c:\myWebServerRoot\knowledgeTree") then you must set your as follows:
        $default->rootUrl  = "/knowledgeTree";
     
   - If your webserver is SSL enabled then set this to true (in most cases this will be false) eg.
        $default->sslEnabled = false;
        
   - Set the database properties to point to your MySQL installation
		$default->dbUser           = "root";
		$default->dbPass           = "pass123";
		$default->dbHost           = "localhost";
		$default->dbName           = "release112";

*  Check permissions on the Documents folder
   - The "/Documents" folder MUST be able to be written to by your web server.
     If your web server is running as user "nobody" and group "nobody" (apache default)
     then cd to the files directory and type:

     *nix: 'chown -R nobody.nobody Documents'
     Windows: Check the permissions and security tabs

*  Login:
   - in a web browser goto http://$default->serverName/$default->rootUrl/
   - default user is "admin" with password "admin"

*  Setting System Settings:
   - Click on 'Admin'.
   - Select System Settings.
   - Check that the values are the same as the ones in your environment.php
     (Note: If you are not using LDAP you can leave these settings as is)
   - Click 'Update' to save these settings.
