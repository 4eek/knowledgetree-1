KnowledgeTree Upgrade instructions
==================================

Basic upgrade
-------------

In order to upgrade your KnowledgeTree installation, perform the following tasks:
- Run the appropriate database upgrade scripts against your database.  If you are upgrading more than one version, multiple
  upgrade scripts will need to be executed.
  eg. if you're upgrading from version 1.2.2 to version 2.0.0, the following upgrade scripts need to be executed:
  - sql/mysql/upgrade/1.2.2-to-1.2.3.sql
  - sql/mysql/upgrade/1.2.3-to-1.2.4.sql
  - sql/mysql/upgrade/1.2.4-to-2.0.0.sql

- Upgrade your application code, by unpacking the latest download into your webroot directory.

- Copy over the changes you made to the configuration to the configuration
  file.

Additional steps
----------------

KnowledgeTree 2.0.0
-------------------

When upgrading to KnowledgeTree 2.0.0, run the following commands from the
KnowledgeTree root directory (not the Root Folder):

	php bin/setPermissionFolder.php
	php bin/rebuildSearchPermissions.php

This requires the CGI or CLI php binary installed.  If there are no error
messages, the process was successful.

You can also run these commands via the web browser.  If your KnowledgeTree
install is at http://example.org/kt/, then go to:

	http://example.org/kt/bin/setPermissionFolder.php
	http://example.org/kt/bin/rebuildSearchPermissions.php

Only errors will be displayed.
