Features
========
* Significant increase in translation support

Bug Fixes
=========
* Properly deal with the rootUrl in some less-travelled cases.

Detailed ChangeLog
==================

2004-10-04 04:39  nbm

        * lib/session/control.inc:

        In the !bReturnLink case, prepend the rootUrl to the quickly-generated
        URL.  This fixes the document move and related problems.

2004-09-28 05:12  nbm

        * tests/documentmanagement/viewUI.inc:

        Might as well mark up this test too.
