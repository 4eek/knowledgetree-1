PostgreSQL is not officially supported at this time, and only those
familiar with PostgreSQL should attempt to do so, and should expect
problems until this file changes or disappears.

Please put patches on the patch tracker on the KnowledgeTree project
page, and send an email to kt-dms-developers@lists.sourceforge.net

Starting steps:

createdb dms
psql dms < tables.sql
psql dms < user.sql
psql dms < functions.sql

You might need to use a specific username when interacting with
PostgreSQL tools, such as the "postgres" or "pgsql" user.  This can be
done by passing the "-U postgres" option (for example) to the tool.  So:

createdb -U postgres dms
psql -U postgres dms < tables.sql
psql -U postgres dms < user.sql
psql -U postgres dms < functions.sql
